# DevOps Girls in Testing - 101 workshop

![DevOps Girls](/images/devopsgirls.jpg)

In this repository are the slides and content for DevOps Girls in Testing - 101 workshop.

## This workshop

This workshop is offered with a few tweaks:

* for intro attendees only
* with a Testing in DevOps flavour
* a smaller, more intimate group
* half day, not full day

You will most likely be in a testing role or be interested in testing, and not have attended any of our previous bootcamps, be completely new to DevOps, or feel that a previous bootcamp was too advanced to follow.

Come join us in this workshop and meet other awesome girls in tech! Remember to bring your laptop as this workshop will be completely hands-on.
