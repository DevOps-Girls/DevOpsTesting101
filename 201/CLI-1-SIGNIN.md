* One has to select a support plan. You will need to select basic support plan to avoid any costs.
* In AWS there is a free Tier of products that can be used with a personal account.
* Once registration completed and you have signed up, there will be a large number of services available to you.
* At the end of the boot camp, terminate any resource used / consumed. One needs to be responsible for resources used.
