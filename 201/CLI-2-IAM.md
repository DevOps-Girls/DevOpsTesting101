## IAM - (15min)

Identity and Access Management:

This component will take you through
 * Finding your unique Sign-in link
 * Creating a User with relevant permissions for CLI and Console access
 * Creating Groups with relevant permissions
 * Introduction to Roles
 * Getting your Access keys


 Navigating AWS Console is decently straight forward: in this section will be working in IAM.

 You can access the service from the 'Services' drop down on the top left corner of the screen.

Each AWS Account gets a unique Sign URL that created IAM users can use to log into the Console.
This can be found on the main Dashboard tab under IAM.
