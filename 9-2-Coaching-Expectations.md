We need coaches to hover around and help our participants with any questions or other issues they might have as they go through the course content. There are a few roles our coaches can take on throughout the day:

# Coaching roles

## Slack channel monitors

Some people will feel comfortable asking questions in our Slack channel, so we need a few people ready to answer them.

## Table helpers

Other participants might be more comfortable with in-person assistance, so we have a coach sitting at each table, ready to help.

## Roamers

A couple of people can wander the room, providing ad-hoc assistance where other helpers are already occupied. Look out for people with furrowed brows or other confused looks on their faces, and ask them if they need a hand.

## Latecomer helpers

Latecomers might need a bit more help coming up to speed, so it’d help them to have a dedicated helper (perhaps not for the whole session, but at least while they get going).

# What we expect of our coaches:

- You’ve run through the course content beforehand, so you’re familiar with what people will be doing, and can explain what’s going on. While that might sound a bit scary, don’t panic! You don’t need to know everything, just enough to be able to point people in the right direction - you can always ask other coaches for help if you’re not sure about a particular question somebody has.
- You’ll socialise with the participants during the event - we want them to feel welcome! If you see people standing alone during the breaks, have a chat to them and see how they’re going.
